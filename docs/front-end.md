# Front End


## Templates

- Shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

# Figma integration
- https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/figma

- I want to have a way to convert Figma designs to shadcn-ui components.
- I want to create a sync between Figma and the project so that when I make changes to the Figma design, I can pull them into the project.
    - A designer will use the template. 
    - The designer will export the Figma design as a JSON file.
    - The JSON file will be converted to a shadcn-ui component.
    - The shadcn-ui component will be added to the project.
    - The designer will then be able to make changes to the Figma design and the component will be updated automatically.
