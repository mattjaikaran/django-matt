# Machine Learning

- LLM/AI IDE integration
    - Cursor context files
    - I want others using this framework to have the best experience with LLM/AI IDE integration. 
    - Need open source LLM/AI IDE integration support. 
- PyTorch
    - I want to use PyTorch for the main machine learning needs of the project.
- Need a way to have good integration to make this app handle Machine Learning/Deep Learning/RAG/MCP/AI Agents/all kinds of machine learning/AI stuff and just kinda optimize shit for the best experience.
